<p class="legendary">games</p>
<p>
    For as long as I can remember computer games were my passion and not only from graphics/gameplay
    perspective but also from mechanics: how are they implemented and why in such way not the other.
</p>
<p>I am not trying to close myself in genres but If I would have to decide then I would say without that the most fun I
    have playing <span>Open World/Exploration</span>, <span>RPG</span>, <span>Creative/Sandbox</span> games.<br>
    To point out a few of the titles I really hold dear. First two would be
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/466300/" class="link" target="_blank">Planescape: Torment</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/" class="link" target="_blank">Enderal: Forgotten Stories</a>.
    Most probably the next on the list would be
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/39510/" class="link" target="_blank">Gothic</a> series(I think also
    nostalgia has something to say here),
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/" class="link" target="_blank">Witcher</a> series
    or old Infinity Engine games like
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257350/" class="link" target="_blank">Baldur's Gate</a>.
    But I think that's enough of those <span>RPG's</span>...<br>
    From <span>Creative/Sandbox</span> genres building games like
    <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" class="link" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/" class="link" target="_blank">Terraria</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/" class="link" target="_blank">Starbound</a> and...
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/" class="link" target="_blank">Skyrim</a>... Maybe Bethesda games
    lack a lot in case of Story but they sure know how to make a living world waiting for you to explore and just
    before you notice you have sunk for another hours in exploring another dark dungeon with same generic enemies, with
    same generic loot, with same generic assets but hey it was fun.<br>
    I could just sit here and count the games I enjoyed and describe with a lot more details why I enjoyed them, but
    that is something that would require a whole blog just to cover that. So I will leave you with just a few more
    random yet amazing games:
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/" class="link" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/" class="link" target="_blank">Graveyard Keeper</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/455820/" class="link" target="_blank">Omensight</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292910/" class="link" target="_blank">Deponia</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/" class="link" target="_blank">Hollow Knight</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/" class="link" target="_blank">Darkest Dungeon</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239070/" class="link" target="_blank">Hammerwatch</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/" class="link" target="_blank">Doom</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/48700/" class="link" target="_blank">Mount & Blade</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/50620/" class="link" target="_blank">Darksiders series</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/17450/" class="link" target="_blank">Dragon Age</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/297120/" class="link" target="_blank">Heavy Bullets</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/718650/" class="link" target="_blank">Driftland</a>,
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/200710/" class="link" target="_blank">Torchlight II</a>
    and many... many... many more.
</p>
<p>
    And of course let's not forget about the board games! I enjoy them too but mostly cooperation based ones or
    <span>Terraforming Mars</span> or <span>Catan</span>. Beside those party games like <span>Time's up!</span>, <span>Red7</span>...
    And I could throw a few more in here too. And why no links? These are Borad Games that is a
    medium that requires a little more from it's players than computer games so I think You dear reader can manage to
    look them up. ;)

<p class="legendary">vector graphics/illustration</p>
<p>
    At some point I got really invested into vector graphics. It's my second/third biggest interest after programming
    and games. This whole page was designed and illustrated by me. I know it can look a little 'empty' or lacking but
    with more time and inspiration It can be hugely improved. But if you would ba interested into seeing more of my work
    I will be sure to leave a link in <span>about me</span> page to place where you can check them out.
